Hi 👋 My name is Omar Cayam

Web Developer | Educator | Graphic Designer
-------------------------------------------

Former aspiring med students turned programmer. I spent the last 6 years of my life coding web applications initially with PHP but I also now ship apps using React/Vue and Node. I work as a computer instructor during the day teaching students the fundamental of programming primarily using C. On the nights, I create web applications that for small businesses (e.g. inventory management systems) and apps that help speed up my work as an educator
